# Codebase Audit

## 1. Front (High-Level Architecture & Design)

- Project structure: How modules, folders, and packages are organized.
- Architecture choices: Whether the system follows patterns (MVC, layered architecture, microservices, etc.) consistently.
- Dependencies: How third-party libraries, frameworks, and APIs are integrated.
- Documentation & onboarding: Readability of README, setup instructions, configuration files.

## 2. Middle (Core Logic & Implementation)

- Code quality: Consistency of style, naming, formatting, and readability.
- Patterns & practices: Use of SOLID principles, DRY/KISS, modularity, single responsibility.
- Correctness: Whether logic does what itâ€™s supposed to do, handling of edge cases.
- Testing: Coverage, reliability, unit vs. integration tests, mocks/fakes.
- Security: Input validation, sanitization, authentication/authorization, secrets management.

## 3. Back (Low-Level Details & Runtime Concerns)

- Performance: Algorithmic complexity, memory usage, database queries, caching.
- Error handling: Robustness of exception management and logging.
- Infrastructure/config: CI/CD pipelines, deployment scripts, Dockerfiles, environment variables.
- Legacy/tech debt: Identifying brittle areas, outdated libraries, and upgrade paths.

## 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns

- Maintainability: Is the codebase easy to extend or modify?
- Consistency: Across languages, frameworks, and modules.
- Compliance: Licensing, coding standards, security audits.
- Team workflows: How pull requests, branches, and versioning are handled.

## 5. Summary

- Frontend: Well-structured, modular, and maintainable.
- Middleware: Solid implementation with good test coverage.
- Backend: Robust with proper error handling and performance considerations.
- Cross-cutting: Consistent and maintainable across the codebase.
