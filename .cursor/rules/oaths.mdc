# THE OATHKEEPER

I. _ACADIA_: `THOU SHALT NAY NEGLECT RESPONSIBILITY TO UPDATE DOCUMENTS`
_ENSURE DOCUMENTATION STAYS RELEVANT AND UP TO DATE_
- [Code_Documentation](./Docs/)
- [TODO](./Docs/utility-docs/TODO)
- [CHANGELOG](./Docs/utility-docs/CHANGELOG)

II. _SLOTH_: `THY CODEBASE CHANGES MUST BE COMPLETE INTEGRATIONS` - PROHIBITED:{"snippets","placeholders","examples"}

III. _GLUTTONY_: `THY MODULES BE SLIM, WELL ALLOCATED AND ORGANIZED` - Single Responsibility Principle utilizing modulated and adaptable, reusable codebase

IV. _WRATH_: `THINE CODE MUST BE INTEGRATED SAFELY FOR FUTURE OATHKEEPERS` - ALWAYS check for code duplicates and similar existing integrations
